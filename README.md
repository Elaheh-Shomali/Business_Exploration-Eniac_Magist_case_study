# Eniac-Magist Partnership Analysis

This project is one of my assignments as a Data Scientist, conducted to evaluate the potential partnership between Eniac and Magist using data-driven techniques. The insights and recommendations aim to inform Eniac’s decision regarding the partnership.

## Overview

In 2018, Eniac, a high-end Apple-compatible accessories retailer based in Spain, explored a potential partnership with Magist, a retail service company from Brazil. This project aimed to evaluate whether Magist could meet Eniac’s standards for delivery efficiency and customer service quality, key components of Eniac’s promise to its customers.

This GitHub repository contains the SQL-based analysis conducted to assess the business synergy between Eniac and Magist, using three years of operational data (October 2016 - October 2018). The analysis provides actionable insights and recommendations to inform Eniac’s decision.

## Key Questions

The analysis centers around three critical questions:

### **1. Is Magist a good fit for Eniac’s high-end products?**

Eniac specializes in high-quality tech products, particularly Apple-compatible accessories. Can Magist’s delivery and service standards align with the expectations of Eniac’s premium customer base?

### **2. How effective is Magist’s delivery service?**

Speed and reliability are crucial to maintaining customer satisfaction. Does Magist’s partnership with the public Post Office ensure timely deliveries without compromising cost?

### **3. Is Magist a good provider of customer service?**

Customer service plays a pivotal role in sustaining brand loyalty. How does Magist’s service quality compare to Eniac’s requirements?
